## About

node-autotip is command-line based version of the Forge mod [Autotip](https://github.com/Semx11/Autotip) (by [Semx11](https://hypixel.net/members/semx11.20123), [2Pi](https://hypixel.net/members/2pi.22108) and [Sk1er](https://hypixel.net/members/sk1er.199731)).
It is useful for long afk sessions, e.g. overnight.

Advantage of using node-autotip instead of the official mod is greatly smaller electricity costs, as it doesn't require any game rendering. This is achieved by communicating with the server directly using minecraft's protocol.
